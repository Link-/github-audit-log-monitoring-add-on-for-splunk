# CHANGELOG

## v1.0.0

- Initial production release. Tested with Splunk 8.0 and Github Enterprise Cloud. Validated by a beta program with Splunk/Github customers.
- As part of the beta program we verified this only works with Splunk 8.0 or above as it requires Python3.
- Addressed Splunk Cloud requirements that all external communications be limited to SSL communications, thus enforcing HTTPS use for the Github API.

## v0.2.0

- Initial beta build
